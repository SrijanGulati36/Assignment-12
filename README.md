## 🎯 Project Objective

This project requires building a basic inventory management system using React and Bootstrap. 
The application must display a list of products, allow users to search through the list in real time, 
add new products using an input form, and delete existing products from the table. 
The goal is to understand component-based design, state management, event handling, and styling with Bootstrap 
while creating a functional interactive UI.
